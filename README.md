## Rating Prediction on Google Play Store Apps

### Project Scope

App developers often struggle to attract users and maintain their interest over time. However, by understanding the factors associated with high app scores, developers can develop strategies to increase user engagement and create a positive user experience, ultimately contributing to higher scores and increased app usage. The data mining applications that are used in this project use certain features of apps in the Google Play Store to help developers predict how many out of 5 ratings their app will receive.
